      <h2>About Petar Hektorović pond</h2>
      <p>The most well-known structure and a representation of the Old Town is Peter Hektorović's fortress, his
        fortified summer home and the place where he wrote Fishing and Fishermen's Complaining, the first realistic epic
        of the Croatian Renaissance.</p><br>
      <p>This fortress was carefully constructed by the Christian thinker and poet of the Renaissance, and it was just
        as important to him as his most important piece of writing. Hektorović's vision of constructing a microcosm a
        small enclosed world where all of God's creations fish, birds, plants, and people had space to live was
        accomplished by the construction of Tvrdalj.</p><br>

      <p>The most recognizable part of Tvrdalj is the pond, which is surrounded by a porch and contains free living fish
        “mullet” and a small tower with pigeon and sparrow nests made of stone. The pond was probably built on the ruins
        of some old swimming pool or harbor structure and behind it on the south is a well kept lawn with plants that
        his friends sent to him.</p><br>
      <p>In addition the pond is covered with inscriptions, the largest of which conveys a message of transience
        “Remember that nothing can save you from death, not even fame, fortune or aging”.</p><br>

      <p>A small but fascinating ethnographic collection of objects from everyday island life and those connected to the
        economy. Particularly wine and olive growing, can be found in Hektorović's Tvrdalj western wing. Many of the
        original pieces, many of which are still present today as an essential component of a typical Dalmatian tavern,
        were preserved and used to create the collection in 1964.</p><br>
