                <li>Good Design Techniques - CRAP</li>
                <li>Organization of information – text and graphics make sense</li>
                <li>Content – interesting read, excellent grammar, perfect spelling</li>
                <li>Navigation – easy to get around, intuitive, well labeled</li>
                <li>Use of HTML5 and CSS3 (both text and positioning)</li>
                <li>A separate linked "Reference" page (in addition to the 10 required content
                    pages. You will lose 10% for not having a "References" page.)</li>
                <li>Document what you have done in each and every grading category above,
                    which is linked from your homepage.

            <h3> 1. Grading Criteria</h3>
            <p>The color flows through the whole site. Balance with text and images. Two images per site, not counting
                the header image. Same information for places that have working hours, individual map for all places.
                White space in balance. The logo was created by me.</p>
            <h3> 2. and 3. Grading Criteria</h3>
            <p>The content is read multiple times, all written in one document (P1_content). Images are carefully picked
                with resolution and angle in mind. To create the content, I used multiple sources and had red for 7
                hours straight. I chose carefully what to include and, as I said, read multiple times.
            </p>
            <h3> 4. Grading Criteria</h3>
            <p>The page "map.html" or "Places to visit" has all seven places; they are linked to their individual sites.
                The navigation is neat and simple. Not so noticeable links, such as drop-down menus or "h3/h2" links,
                are marked with little arrows that draw attention.</p>
            <h3> 5. Grading Criteria</h3>
            <p>All ids and classes in HTML documents are neatly and appropriately named. The css file has all the css;
                it is commented by a collection of similar code.</p>
            <h3> 6. Grading Criteria</h3>
            <p>The "Reference" page can be accessed through the navigation bar. It's determined by the sites and the
                material (an image or text). Images are numbered from 0 to 1, with 0 being the header image. Text isn't
                labeled as it was used only to make me learn the material.</p>
            <h3> 7. Grading Criteria</h3>
            <p>This was the brief information of what I have done to replace said document.</p>
